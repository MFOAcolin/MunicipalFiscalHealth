This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

#load FIR data
load("fir.RDA")

FC2013 <- fir %>%
  mutate("population" = as.numeric(slc.02.41.01),
         "population.group" = cut(population, 
                                  breaks = c(0,2500,5000, 7500,10000,10000000), #define population breaks
                                  labels=c("<2.5k","2.5-5k","5k-7.5K","7.5k-10k","Big"), #name population breaks
                                  ordered_result=TRUE),
         "households" = as.numeric(slc.02.40.01),
         "TCAs" = slc.51.9910.06, "weighted.assessment" = slc.261.9199.17,
         "fiscal.capacity" = weighted.assessment/households,
         "infrastructure.intensity" = TCAs/households,
         "investment.urgency" = slc.51.9910.10/TCAs) %>%
  filter(MARSYEAR == 2013, #filter by FIR year
        population.group != "Big" #filter by population group
         ) %>%
  select(MUNID, LT1NAME, MUNTIER, MARSYEAR, region, population.group, fiscal.capacity, 
         infrastructure.intensity, investment.urgency) %>%
  na.omit()
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE, dev='CairoPNG', comment=FALSE}
#Plot Infrastructure Intensity vs. Fiscal Capacity
ggplot(FC2013, aes(infrastructure.intensity, fiscal.capacity, col = population.group, shape = region))+
  geom_point(size = 4, position = "jitter", alpha = 0.8)+
  ggtitle("Fiscal Capacity vs. Infrastructure Intensity Under 10K")+
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept=319000), colour="red", linetype="dashed")+
  coord_fixed(1/10)+
  ylim(0,619000)+
  xlim(0,69000)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
